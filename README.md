# Sentiment Analysis in AI and Cinema

This is the code I wrote as part of my final paper in AI and Cinema, a class in the University of Virginia's Media Studies Dept that focuses on the relationship between imagined technologies and the world around us. 
This final project examined sentiment analysis through the data usage process, taking class discussions from the semester and determining the primary emotions expressed week over week during the semester.
